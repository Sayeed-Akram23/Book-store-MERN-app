# My MERN Book Store

This full-stack web application is designed to help book enthusiasts discover, explore, and manage their favorite books. Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), this platform offers a user-friendly interface for browsing and categorizing books.
## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to set up both the frontend and backend.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Create a .env file in the backend directory, and add your configuration(PORT number and MongoDB_URL).

Start the backend server:

```


### Database Setup

Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running. Update the MongoDB connection details in the .env files for the backend.
